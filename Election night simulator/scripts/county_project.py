"""Projector v1: project the count county by county.

v0 sees one number per state (share counted, visible margin). v1 sees every county: how many votes it
still has to count, and how its counted votes compare with its benchmark. That is what told Michigan
(Detroit's absentees still out) from Pennsylvania (not enough left in Philadelphia) in 2024.

For one race at one moment:
  1. Each county's lean L_c: its two-party Democratic (non-Republican) share on the log-odds scale at
     a tied statewide result (county_benchmarks.py's method: recent races averaged, uniform swing).
  2. Each county that has counted votes implies a statewide shift x_c = logit(counted share) - L_c.
     Weighted by votes counted, discounted while the county is still early in its count (its first
     batches are one kind of ballot), they give the statewide shift d and its uncertainty.
  3. A starting point (the markets' price at poll close, or our model) is a prior on d.
  4. Each county's uncounted votes (NYT's expected vote minus votes counted) are projected at
     expit(L_c + d + k_c * e_c): the statewide shift plus a share k_c of the county's own deviation
     e_c = x_c - d, trusted more as the county counts more.
  5. Simulated thousands of times with the shift's uncertainty, county errors and turnout errors
     (NYT's expected vote misses) -> projected final margin and P(the non-Republican wins).

Margins are non-Republican minus Republican in points of all votes (the two-party margin times the
two-party share of the counted vote). Parameters (PARAMS) are set by the replay in county_replay.py.
